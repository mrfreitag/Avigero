            <thetext>As reported in the MozillaZine forums a couple of days ago, the nightly-build links from the web site are broken and cause a &quot;not found&quot; error.

http://www.seamonkey-project.org/dev/nightly

The reason appears to be that they try to find 2.1b3pre in comm-central-trunk.</thetext>

            <thetext>Either make it seamonkey/nightly/latest-comm-2.0/seamonkey-2.1b3pre.* or seamonkey/nightly/latest-comm-central-trunk/seamonkey-2.2a1pre.* instead,
where the comm-central/mozilla-2.0 builds may be the preferred ones until SeaMonkey 2.1 is closing in on release and comm-central/mozilla-central
gets the attention again.</thetext>

            <thetext>The problem there is that&apos;s I&apos;m not sure that linking to 2.2a1pre builds is what we want there, but linking to comm-2.0 would need a larger change in the website template to do it correctly.

Linking to 2.2a1pre would just be a change of the variable in the config.tmpl file (I think that&apos;s what it&apos;s called).</thetext>

&gt; The problem there is that&apos;s I&apos;m not sure that linking to 2.2a1pre builds is
&gt; what we want there,

Agreed, the last comm-central/mozilla-central nightly was March 31, so that&apos;s spotty (and likely buggy) at best.

&gt; but linking to comm-2.0 would need a larger change in the
&gt; website template to do it correctly.

If you look at it from the positive side, this may be a good opportunity to make the template more general to be covered in future similar situations.  ;-)</thetext>

            <thetext>Looking at seamonkeyproject-org/src/dev/nightly.en.html, the path constructs
as [% develdownloadbase %]/seamonkey-[% develversion %].en-US.*, thus another level for the branch would be needed with a similar variable in config.tmpl,
[% develdownloadbase %]-[% develbranch %]/seamonkey-[% develversion %].en-US.*

  develdownloadbase = http://.../latest-comm
  develbranch = 2.0
  develversion = 2.1b3pre

This might be the most flexible solution.</thetext>
