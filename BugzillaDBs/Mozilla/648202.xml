            <thetext>The comm-2.0 based pollers seem to be polling against the trunk, and not the release/mozilla-2.0 based setup (Noticed by failures caused from mozilla-revisions in trunk not 2.0)

Also of note in the investigation is that we are generating two changesources that are interesting to our comm-2.0 builder for comm-central, per checkin.

CC-ing catlee incase he has any ideas at hand, especially after my HgPoller changes.

Of note is that I only have reconfigured since applying my change there, have not shutdown/restarted the master.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok actually it is not the HgPoller that is the issue, and sadly this was the case for a while (just didn&apos;t catch it because our automation used to always update to default)

http://mxr.mozilla.org/build/source/buildbotcustom/misc.py?mark=1744-1744,1752-1752#1736

This is a problem because for both our comm-2.0 and comm-central-trunk builds, this actually points to the same place.

catlee, how do you feel about s/branch=config[&apos;repo_name&apos;]/branch=name/ here and in generateBranchObjects. (For poller and Scheduler)

I feel it is more correct, unless there is some trick about the branch format I don&apos;t recognize, or some reason that would cause undesirable affects. (It is times like this I wish SeaMonkey had a staging environment I could test these theories/assumptions)</thetext>

We have some cases where name != repo_name, so this won&apos;t work in general.

Why does this help your case here?</thetext>

            <thetext>well, we have pushlogoverride for HgPoller, which is what we use. But the issue stems from repo_name being used twice for separate |name| branches.

we have config[&apos;comm-2.0&apos;]            with repo comm-central
we have config[&apos;comm-central-trunk&apos;]  with repo comm-central

Such that it then notifies the scheduler with |repo_name| and thats where the problem starts, since we also have it with {mozilla-2.0,mozilla-central} for the respective configs.

Which means that a mozilla-central change, gets sent to the scheduler for comm-2.0 due to this. And I wonder if there is a way I can fix this without diverging us from the m-c based generate* here.</thetext>

            <thetext>Note that you IIRC need to do a buildbot restart to make pollers update for such a branch change (or at least I remember that has been the case some time ago). Did we already have a buildbot restart since we introduced a comm-2.0 that should correctly track mozilla-2.0?</thetext>
