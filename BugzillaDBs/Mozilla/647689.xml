Whatever value was meant to show up as &quot;Date received&quot; for an incoming e-mail message, the value displayed is always effectively &quot;Date sent&quot;. No matter whether there were some delivery problems or delayn en-route...

Should it be the time the email client picked the message from server, or when the last-in-chain server received the message, or even something else?

I&apos;ve one email contact person, who&apos;s local computer&apos;s time is off by approx. 22 minutes to future. Already for years... I&apos;m receiving these e-mails in few seconds, thus their &quot;time sent&quot; is always off by this offset. An example from 15 minutes ago (all IPs (irrelevant) are modified, some IDs stripped):

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
As can be seen on this example, the message was sent on Mon, 4 Apr 2011 17:55:47 +0200 (17:55 my local time). I&apos;ve received the notification about storing the message into my Inbox in a few seconds. At the same moment, it was just 17:22 my local time.

Expected Results:  
I&apos;m expecting seeing &quot;17:22 my local time&quot; as the value for &quot;Date received&quot;.</thetext>

&gt; Go to about:config / mailnews.use_received_date
&gt; Is it set to true or false?
It was set to false. But even after setting it to true, the behavior does not change: received-time is still the exact copy of sent-time.</thetext>

&gt; It was set to false. But even after setting it to true, the behavior does not
&gt; change: received-time is still the exact copy of sent-time.
Just to add: even received-time of the newly coming messages.</thetext>
