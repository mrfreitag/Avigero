Printing of PDFs inside of iframes with the Javascript command print() does not work in Firefox 4. It used to work in Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the test page at http://bertilow.com/div/pdftest/index.html
2. Wait for the PDF to load, then click the button &quot;Print the PDF&quot;.
3. Nothing happens.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
The Firefox print window should open (showing a preview of the PDF).

I have tried using the ordinary Acrobat Reader PDF plugin, and also using mozplugger with Evince. The results are the same: the JavaScript print() function is dead for a PDF inside of an iframe. It is possible to print the entire page, but not the PDF. In Firefox 3 everything works as it always have.

I have tested this mainly in Linux (Ubuntu), but I have seen the same problem in Windows as well.</thetext>

Works fine for me using the latest trunk.

Bertilo can you please verify it again using the latest trunk?

Thanks!</thetext>

            <thetext>I just installed the latest trunk (4.2a1pre - 2011-04-08). The test results were very confusing indeed:

At first everything worked perfectly, using the Acrobat Reader PDF plugin. But, if I remember correctly, not using Mozplugger and Evince. But then I found that it suddenly worked in the official Firefox 4 as well (both with Acrobat and Evince). ??? On the other hand that was in a newly installed Ubuntu 11.04 (beta) where Firefox 4 is actually a version packaged by Ubuntu and thus perhaps not quite the same as vanilla Firefox 4. Acrobat Reader seems to work a bit differently in Ubuntu 11.04 (it seems to use Mozplugger now). When I reported this bug I was on Ubuntu 10.10.

So I went back to my old Ubuntu 10.10, and found that the bug is still there in Firefox 4 and also in the trunk version. :(

But then when I returned to my new Ubuntu 11.04, suddenly it didn&apos;t work in the trunk version any more. But it still worked in the official Firefox 4 (Ubuntu packaged)! Perhaps tomorrow things will be different still. Utterly confusing!

So perhaps this is really a Ubuntu thing, or perhaps not. Aravindm seems to have seen the bug in Windows.</thetext>
