            <thetext>+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #631291 +++

We are about to spin a new comm-2.0 build, and once again need the l10n signoffs performed.

If any locales are added/removed we also need to update shipped-locales in comm-central

I&apos;m still a bit blind on the l10n side of the release management here.

I do notice that https://l10n-stage-sj.mozilla.org/shipping/l10n-changesets?ms=sea2.1b3 is a 404, so not sure specifically what needs to be done on this end or by whom, but Filing now so we can be sure it is done, and ready to go for a spin by midnight (EDT) [9pm Monday PDT]</thetext>

            <thetext>I probably do need to do the sign-offs, as Adrian doesn&apos;t have access to do that on the dashboard right now - I don&apos;t know if I still get around to doing that today, though, I&apos;m still trying to get on top of my unread email...

As for the changesets file not being available - apparently 1) I messed up and never marked Beta 2 as &quot;shipped&quot; on the dashboard, 2) because of that never remembered to ask Pike for creating a Beta 3 milestone there and 3) he probably won&apos;t be fast to react because he&apos;s out partying in Las Vegas until some time tomorrow. Still, Axel, when you&apos;re reading this, could you do it?

We really need to go through me doing sign-offs for Beta 3, though, as we probably have some locales being completely broken by the Chatzilla changes which we can&apos;t merge. Sorry, I should have checked that before. :(</thetext>

            <thetext>I can sign off those locales with those versions for 2.1b3 at this moment:

Italian can&apos;t be signed off at this moment because ChatZilla brokenness causes builds to go green. Others have not requested a sign-off on l10n-mozilla-2.0 yet.</thetext>

            <thetext>OK, we agreed to go with this set, CCing prometeo so he knows we unfortunately need to exclude Italian for this beta - there&apos;s still enough time to jump on the RC/final train, of course.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;d suggest renaming beta 2 to beta 3, and then hit the ship-it button on that for the b3 status. Recreating correct data for b2 is gonna be hard, I&apos;d rather just leave it non-existant in that case.</thetext>

            <thetext>KaiRo, we do have a slight issue.

Not all of your signed off locales passed :( [due to cZ changes]

Failed locales:

* nb-NO
* fi
* sv-SE

I do not think I am going to be respinning for these, but want your ok that losing these locales (+ `it`) is ok for b3.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think those are still signed off with changesets from before that cZ checkin, and I only checked new signoff requests for problems, of which &quot;it&quot; was one.</thetext>

Axel, yes, that sounds good, let&apos;s go with it.</thetext>
