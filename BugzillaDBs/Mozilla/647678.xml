            <thetext>The tracking for the new Firefox 5/next rapid-release channels is Bug 646236.

The product details library can produce a final-release or beta button right now, but it will also need to be able to produce download buttons for the &quot;Aurora&quot; build channel too.

            <thetext>James or Fred - need help with this.  Looks like we add another array value in every product array to cover the new channels.  Could just add an &quot;aurora&quot; element.

If you can think of a better way to restructure this, we can talk about it.</thetext>

            <thetext>+1 for comment 4. But if this needs to be done by next Tuesday, we need an intermediate solution.

What is the end goal we need here? Does it really need to be in product-details? Or do we just need one download button on the new page that lists the different channels?</thetext>

Our main question her is that we&apos;ll have 3 download buttons on this one page--one for aurora, one for beta and the one for final which is fx 4. 

My understanding is that the download details for each build will change every 6 weeks. For now, we need a solution for tuesday for Aurora, and we use what we have for fx 4. I just want to make sure we think this through for the long term.</thetext>

Ok, sounds good. Let&apos;s definitely work towards a separate service. fwiw, we are planning to remove filesizes from the download buttons (bug 645457) which should simplify things. For Tuesday, it&apos;d be nice to avoid filesizes and then it would be easy to hack an Aurora download button.</thetext>

We&apos;re actually not showing file sizes on mozilla.com download buttons unless you have Javascript turned off. It&apos;s weird, but this was because it was quick/easy to remove the file size in the mozilla.com code, but the NOSCRIPT block comes from product-details, to which I don&apos;t have commit access.</thetext>

Oh cool! That should simplify things a bit. I&apos;ll poke around the code and figure out how to add Aurora for now, and that will get me familiar with everything and I can help abstract it away as a service soon.</thetext>

Yeah, we can hard-code for now. We will have to do OS detection though.

What about the Beta download button on /firefox/all-beta.html - can we re-use that?</thetext>

            <thetext>Does that mean that the links are not going through bouncer? No alias for the builds?

Currently a typical link generated by product-details is like that:

http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-4.0&amp;os=linux&amp;lang=fy-NL

We would need some way to build links that are always valid, would it be possible to have something like:

http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-aurora&amp;os=linux&amp;lang=fy-NL

That would help a lot, especially if we need working links in a few days from now.</thetext>
