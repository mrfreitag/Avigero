I cannot get my printer to print anything off of my computer. Also, my screen will stall out and i have to open the task manager to get it to close. It will close the entire program instead of just the window i was working in.   I was creating a sales receipt and saved and then told it to print. The Windows froze up and so i did a task manager and told it to end service and instead of it closing just the sales receipt it closed all of quickbooks. So i went to Authorize.net entered his (customer)information in off of his credit card and submitted it. It was approved so i told it to view printable receipt and again it stalled out and froze and i was unable to get it to print.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on create sales receipt in QkBks and filled out the necessary information, click saved
2.Then i proceeded to Authorize.net, logged in, enter in the his cc info and clicked submit, came back approved to i clicked on the button that was labeled view printable receipts
3.
Actual Results:
