            <thetext>Clearing recent history by time interval, the first time in a browsing session, is extremely slow and the UI is blocked for the entire duration.

1. Make sure your system is using a hard drive and not an SSD
2. Launch Firefox with a new profile, if you&apos;ve heavily customized your browser current profile
3. Make sure you have browsing history for a few days
4. On the day you are to perform this test, make sure you have not cleared history since you launched the browser
5. Use the browser session to do your web surfing, for about an hour or more.
6. Click Tools --&gt; Clear Recent History... --&gt; Last Hour --&gt; Clear Now
7. Note that clearing is slow and the UI is blocked for the duration.</thetext>

            <thetext>You should ensure that you only selected browsing history in the checkboxes before pointing at history, since history clearing is already for the most part async.
I think your issue could instead be cookies, so please, double check in Details what option of Clear History is causing the slowdown.</thetext>

            <thetext>By the way, the first time I noticed the major slowdown came with the landing of the patch that made Firefox store cache files in a bunch of folders.  So I believe that patch is the result of the slowdown.  However, if history clearing is already async, why is the UI being blocked.  And this even with a new profile and default options.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m asking you to figure out which one of the options in Details section causes the slowdown, otherwise this report has no data to proceed.
the ui could be blocking when clearing history because this panel does not only clear history, it also clears cookies, cache and a bunch of other stuff.
So, please help finding which part is slow.</thetext>

            <thetext>My testing reveals that the culprits are both cache and cookies, but cookies more so.  After about an hour of light browsing, clearing cache and then cookies produced the following timings:

Cache: approx 4 sec
Cookies: approx 7 sec

With more browsing history, those number increase somewhat proportionally.  I&apos;ve experienced the UI blocked/unresponsive for over a minute on some occasions.

Later, I will try and post numbers for much greater browsing history.</thetext>

            <thetext>Looks like comment 6 isn&apos;t always true.  I just had cookies not block, but cache blocked for over 10 seconds.

So definitely a problem with clearing cache.  In my default profile I generally don&apos;t clear cookies, because I accept only session cookies, with the exception of cookies permitted by my exceptions.  And it is with this profile that I experience this issue (because it is the profile I use all the time).

Thus, if clearing cache is supposed to be async, maybe it&apos;s only so if clearing all cache, as it most definitely isn&apos;t async when clearing only part of it via Clear Recent History.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m moving to PB since CRH was implemented there, looks like the hang is not related to history.
In the case of cookies this is probably just a dupe of bug 633427.
For the cache I thought it was on a separate thread but I&apos;m unsure.</thetext>

&gt; For the cache I thought it was on a separate thread but I&apos;m unsure.

Could it be that caching is on a separate thread but clearing cache is not?</thetext>

&gt; Please don&apos;t move bugs across components without explaining the reasoning.

I didn&apos;t do it.  It&apos;s a Bugzilla bug.  If you simply refresh a bug page, you see the new comments, but items in the pull-downs are not updated.  Thus, when you post, it resets whatever was changed.</thetext>
