Build Identifier: 

We have several users within our company that have issues with their Calendars staying checked and switched on. We have researched extensively in house and haven&apos;t found a solution. This happens to some weekly and others every couple weeks. When they login to their Lightning Calendar the entire calendar list on the left is unchecked and grayed out. For users who are connected to 20-40 other employees, this become very tedious when they have to recheck each of these calendars within Properties. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I&apos;ve personally had this occur to me twice in the last few months. Each time I just logged in as normal in morning and they were unchecked.

            <thetext>as a bug report this doesn&apos;t have enough clues to have a very high likelihood of reaching a solution. You should seek help on the forums at http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/support/ where they may be able to put your symptoms together with those of other folks and figure out what&apos;s going on.</thetext>
