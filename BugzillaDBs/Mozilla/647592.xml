While uploading a 72MB youtube video (a lengthy process, taking approximately 40 minutes on my slow internet) Firefox started to eat RAM. By about 80% completion, I was seeing ~2GB memory use by Firefox. This was reaching 2.9GB by the time the video had finished uploading. Firefox was nearly unresponsive on my machine until I ended the process and started back up.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start to upload video to youtube by dragging to upload page
2. Watch Firefox memory usage skyrocket
3.
Actual Results:  
The second time I attemtped to upload a video of similar size and resolution, the upload continued as expected. I tried a third time, and experienced the same memory problems.

Expected Results:  
Not consumed the majority of my system&apos;s memory.</thetext>

&gt; Do you have addons like Firebug installed ?

No. I have Adblock, Greasemonkey, British English Dictionary, the Java Console and Test Pilot. I could try and replicate the bug with Firebug installed, if that would help?</thetext>

            <thetext>Is that a flash based uploader or a http form post ?
Does this happen in the Firefox safemode ?

And finally post the about:memory stats if the memory is consumed by Firefox itself and not the plugin-container and if you get the same problem without addons (safemode).</thetext>

-It is the youtube uploader, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s flash or HTTP based.

-I will try and upload another video in safe mode and report back.</thetext>

            <thetext>Firefox seems to be running smooth as butter in safe mode when uploading. It must be one of the extensions that&apos;s causing the slowdown. The only two add ons that sleepy and I have in common are ad-block.</thetext>

            <thetext>I also got no slowdown when in safe mode. However the bug seems to be intermittent when not in safe mode.</thetext>

            <thetext>The safmode does more than disabling the extensions:
Disabled are : Extensions, JS JIT and Hardware acceleration.</thetext>

            <thetext>Okay, I noticed the same things as sleepy in safe mode. The browser itself is fast, but the upload itself is still slow and intermittent. I am now uploading a video in IE about the same size and it&apos;s uploading at double the speed. FF seems to hang when it uploads to you tube and  take forever.

All in all, I don&apos;t think this is fully an add on issue, because in safe mode problems are still seen. Have you been able to recreate this Matti?</thetext>

            <thetext>&quot;FF
seems to hang&quot;

FF itself doesn&apos;t hang, I was referring to the upload.</thetext>
