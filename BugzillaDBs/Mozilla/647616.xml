When doing a search using the address bar, I will get the following message (for example just typing google in the address bar)

Firefox can&apos;t find the file at jar:file:///H:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/omni.jar!/chrome/en-US/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesgoogle.

I do not know why it searches for a jar file with the word I put up there appended to it. Also, it does not happen to every computer I use.

I have tried different things such as a fresh re-install of firefox (unistalling and deleting every files) to no avail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type &quot;google&quot; in the address bar.
2.Press Enter.
3.Wait a few seconds.
Actual Results:  
The following error happened: 

Firefox can&apos;t find the file at jar:file:///H:/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/omni.jar!/chrome/en-US/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesgoogle.

Expected Results:  
Seeing the google search page.</thetext>

            <thetext>Does the issue still occur if you start Firefox in Safe Mode? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe+Mode

How about with a new, empty profile? http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Basic+Troubleshooting#Make_a_new_profile</thetext>

            <thetext>This is 99% bug 641271, but cyberwolf, please give us some answers first:

* Have you done a pave-over installation or an upgrade?
* Which version of Firefox existed before?
* Which locale of Firefox are you using?
* Have you used zip builds before or always updated/installed a new version of Firefox?</thetext>

            <thetext>Also do you use a cleanup tool on your machine which removes uninstaller log files? That would probably be the reason I&apos;m thinking of.</thetext>

            <thetext>It still will do that with a new profile as well as in safe mode. I had initially done an upgrade from 4 RC2, but then when I had this problem, uninstalled and reinstalled. 

Tomorrow as soon as I have some time for this, I will uninstall, run some tools to clear this as it was suggested in comment 3, and will let you know after reinstalling.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks guys, I guess the uninstall did leave something behind as I have uninstalled, ran the cleaner, removed the Firefox entries and reinstalled. Now I get the home page when starting Firefox as well as being able to search with that bar. 

If I see someone else talking about it I will let them know.

Thanks.</thetext>
