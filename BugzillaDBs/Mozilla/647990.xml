            <thetext>According to bug 637660 comment 12, the crashtests disabled in that bug should have been re-enabled when bug 638844 (dup of bug 638846) was fixed.  But that was mentioned in neither the manifest nor the followup bug, so of course it didn&apos;t happen.

PLEASE annotate manifests with bug numbers whenever you disable tests!  (Reviewers: please enforce this!)  Otherwise, it&apos;s nearly impossible for my automated tools to detect when you forget to re-enable them when the bug is fixed.  I only happened to notice this mistake because I was behind in reading the changelog, and came across both bugs at the same time.</thetext>

            <thetext>these tests were disabled without any bug indicating why they failed.  The Mobile team was busy releasing instead of debugging and they are now working on fixing failed crash/reftests and/or documenting why they are not running.

bug 638844 had nothing to do with fixing the bug, rather turning the tests on.  Probably a mixed up bug or message somewhere.</thetext>

            <thetext>Explained to me at the all-hands:

The mobile automated testing team wanted to get the suites green quickly so they could be shown on TBPL and prevent ongoing regressions. They decided to mark tests as skip-if(Android) etc for now and file bugs later.

I hope that happens relatively soon :)</thetext>
