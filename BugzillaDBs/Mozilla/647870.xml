FireFox 4 has not resolved its printing problems yet.
At http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/04/correspondence-with-helen-caldicott/ there are 15 pages of text with side bars to be printed. I can get all 15 printed without the side bars being truncated using IE 8.0.6001.18702 . Using Firefox 4.0 it will only print the first, second and last page out of the 15 pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/04/correspondence-with-helen-caldicott/
2.Print on HP Laserjet 1000 printer. Only 3 pages out of 15 are printed
3.Compare print output with that provided by IE 8.0.

Actual Results:  
4 You&apos;ll notice 12 pages are missing. Only 1st, 2nd and last page are printed and the side bar is truncated on the right as well.

Expected Results:  
5. All 15 pages should have been printed without the side bar truncated.

This is a very serious printing problem which appeared in various forms for many many years. It prevents FireFox from ever being adequately usable in a business environment where printed hard copy must be available.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;ve reported a similar bug with older versions of FireFox prior to 4.0 where only the first page is printed out of many but I&apos;m unable to find them using the Bugzilla Search capability using my last name &quot;Ronback&quot;. Is there a way of finding your old closed bug reports?
This bug is unique in that it prints the first couple of pages, drops many pages and then prints the last page.</thetext>

&gt; This bug is unique in that it prints the first couple of pages, drops many
&gt; pages and then prints the last page.

That&apos;s actually not that out of the ordinary - I&apos;ve seen things like that a lot.

What Firefox does here is something like this:
* [Render header content] --&gt; page 1
* [Render main body; realize that it&apos;s in some sort of container that resists being split, and won&apos;t fit on the first page; push this container to 2nd page so that it&apos;s got as much space as possible.  It still gets clipped at the bottom of 2nd page.] --&gt; page 2
* [Render footer content] --&gt; page 3

Firefox 3.0 behaves similarly to trunk, and Firefox 3.6 skips the 2nd page for some reason (printing 2 pages), but probably has a form of the same problem.</thetext>

&gt; * [Render main body; realize that it&apos;s in some sort of container that resists
&gt; being split

In this case, it&apos;s resisting being split because it has &quot;display: inline-block&quot;.
