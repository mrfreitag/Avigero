            <thetext>Thunderbird 3.1.9
Windows XP SP3

Steps To Reproduce:

1. Open a received HTML formatted message with an image displayed inline
2. Open a new compose window in HTML formatted display
3. By any method, attempt to transfer the image to the compose window

Result:

Does not work, the image is not transferred, only a &quot;missing image&quot; type box is the result.

100% reproducible

Some users report that it used to work in previous 2.x and 3.x-pre versions.</thetext>

            <thetext>Addendum

Forgot to clarify #3. &quot;By any method&quot;. By any method per this bug means drag/drop from window to window or copy/paste from window to window. Saving the image first and then copy/paste works.</thetext>

            <thetext>jay, can you double-click on the image to open the Image Properties and see
if the Location looks like &quot;mailbox:///C%7C/&quot;? If yes, and if changing the
&quot;%7C&quot; part to &quot;mailbox:///C:/&quot; or &quot;mailbox:///C|/&quot; instead resolves the issue, this should be a duplicate of bug 224733.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks, but that&apos;s not quite what I meant; copy-paste or drag-and-drop an
image from one message your are looking at into one that you compose. There
you should see the &quot;broken image&quot; box. Double-click on that box in the message you compose, this should open the Image Properties with the pasted location.
If it&apos;s the bug I&apos;m thinking of, the &quot;C|&quot; should have been translated to &quot;C%7C&quot; which breaks the picture in your new message.</thetext>

            <thetext>WOW what an active bug..just mid-aired 3 times
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:2.0pre) Gecko/20110401 Thunderbird/3.3a4pre
is showing the same symptoms, and I&apos;m pretty sure this regressed
Editing &quot;%7c&quot; to &quot;|&quot; restores the image here.</thetext>

            <thetext>(In reply to comment #6)
&gt; I just tied this.  Originally the Location began &quot;mailbox:///C|/&quot; which did not
&gt; find the image, but changing it to &quot;mailbox:///C:/&quot; DID find the image.

As Joe stated, those two forms should be equivalent, so I&apos;m a bit puzzled too
(a) why you don&apos;t see the &quot;%7C&quot; escaped version of &quot;|&quot; in your location, and
(b) why once you have a &quot;|&quot; it doesn&apos;t work. So, not as straight-forward of a duplicate as I initially thought...</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, here it the results of dbl clicking the image/box:

Changing the %7C to | causes the image to be displayed properly. Now what?</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, that&apos;s what I&apos;d expect to see due to bug 224733, so it&apos;s indeed a duplicate of that bug. I don&apos;t know what happened in comment #6, any more details?</thetext>

            <thetext>Changing the %7C to : also displays the image properly. So now where do we go from here? 224733 is quite old and stale being filed in 2003 and the last comment by David A in 2008.</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes, but it&apos;s a duplicate anyway... it&apos;s policy to dupe a new bug against the older one, especially if some further analysis was provided there already.
Also, running into dupes frequently &quot;revives&quot; old bugs even after a long time
of no action (some bugs fixed were as old as 10 years), thus there&apos;s hope.

            <thetext>BTW: There is an extension available fixing the issue after the fact:

(Quoting bug 224733 comment #12)
&gt; In the meantime the bug is fixed, you can find a workaround in my extension
&gt; QuoteAndComposeManager, here:
&gt; https://nic-nac-project.org/~kaosmos/realborders-en.html
&gt; See also https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380372 for another bug
&gt; related to inline images paths.

I&apos;ve suggested to the developer of that extension to post a patch, but since he is fixing the broken HTML code once the damage has already happened it&apos;s not possible to derive a core fix from that extension.</thetext>

            <thetext>Why is this labeled &quot;RESOLVED&quot;?  It now refers to bug 224733 which is 8 years old!  If that ancient bug was truly &quot;resolved&quot;, we shouldn&apos;t be seeing it in the current Thunderbird.

Apparently the bug resurrected itself.  Pernicious darn thing!

So, from the perspective of a lowly user, it definitely is NOT resolved.</thetext>
