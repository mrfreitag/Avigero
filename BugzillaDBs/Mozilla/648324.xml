            <thetext>If you start Firefox in Safe Mode - does that let you preserve your newly created bookmarks?

            <thetext>i tried safe mode, with unexpected results. some of my add-ons reinstalled themselves and/or re-enabled themselves after restart. The book mark issue had seemed to go away, but I just noticed that the bookmarks i save last night have now disappeared after restarting the app today. One thing I DID do differently, I watched a streaming movie on Netflix and had to reinstall their player.

So, I have too many variables here. Is it the add-ons (likely) or is it a bug with bookmarks. If anyone has any clues i&apos;d like to track this down, and in the mean time I&apos;ll see if i can reproduce the exact process...

One thing to note--NO Bookmarks that I have saved since installing FF 4 have been saved. All have disappeared after i have quit FF and restarted.

i&apos;ll check bug reports for similar issues.

Thanks.</thetext>

            <thetext>I agree it&apos;s likely there is a problem with an add-on.

You may try to track it down by disabling them all, and the enable them one by one until the problem reoccurs.

Since there seems to be some kind of mess with your profile I also suggest you create a new one:
