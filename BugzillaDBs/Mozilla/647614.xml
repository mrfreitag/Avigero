            <thetext>User-Agent:       Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.7.62 Version/11.01
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100722 Eudora/3.0.4

In Eudora 7.1 I had the mail alerts set up to open a mailbox when an email was received.  Could we have this feature back please?
This was one of the major benefits of using Eudora as with many folders there comes a point where they drop out of the window and it is easy to miss messages; however I could guarantee that once all windows were closed I had NOT missed any messages.
This is a feature that vastly enhances my productivity so please can we have it back?

Reproducible: Always




This may need to be added in tandem with Bug 417230 - Multiple windows, WITHIN Eudora main window (support MDI)</thetext>
